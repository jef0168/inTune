	inTune is a social media platform for musicians to meet with other like minded musicians to form bands, make friends, or just jam - like a "musical hookup". As a musician, I have always struggled with finding people to jam with. Often times I have to settle for jamming with musicians with different music tastes, or extreme amateurs where I end up having to teach instead of jam. inTune is an effort to streamline the process, so future starting up musicians will not have to settle.
	inTune is designed for musicians, but it can be used by anyone who enjoys music. Upon creating a profile the user will have the option to specify what kind of profile they will be creating. Either "Musician", "Venue", or "Fan." Venue profiles will have the ability to post upcoming shows hosted at their venue, link musician profiles who are playing, and explore local musicians by genre. Fans will have the option to upvote their favorite local musicians, repost sound clips and videos from musicians and venues, and rsvp to shows posted by venues. A musician’s profile will contain a bio, and three individual sound blips around 20 seconds in length. A musician may be able to upload videos, but we plan on putting a lot of literal limitations on what can be posted- like video lengths, duration their posted and etc. All accounts will be able to hide, and report other users.
	For this to come to life we plan on using Google’s Firebase to host our application. The front end will be written mostly in Javascript, html5, and CSS, and we will use the firebase API to make server commands. React is also something we will try experimenting with that will probably replace out html for the front end.
