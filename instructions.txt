Instructions getting started:
Make sure nodejs is installed
then create a new react app with the following command:

npx create-react-app in-tune

This will create a directory with all of the stuff you need
From there delete the following:
logo.svg
index.css

Now install all dependencies:
npm install --save react-router-dom
npm install --save @material-ui/core
npm install @material-ui/icons

replace the files that are left in the directory
with the files that are on github.
To run use:
npm start 

inside the directory
